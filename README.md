5. Admin Role Management

To set an existing user as an admin, run the following SQL command in your SQLite database:

UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'admin_username';

Replace admin_username with the actual username you want to grant admin privileges to.

6. Database Backup

It is recommended to back up the database regularly to prevent data loss. You can manually create a backup using the following command:

sqlite3 medicine_inventory.db .dump > backup.sql

To restore the database from a backup:

sqlite3 new_medicine_inventory.db < backup.sql

Alternatively, you can automate backups using a Python script:

import shutil
import os

def backup_database():
    db_path = "medicine_inventory.db"
    backup_path = f"backup_{db_path}"

    if os.path.exists(db_path):
        shutil.copy(db_path, backup_path)
        print("Database backup successful!")
    else:
        print("Database file not found!")

7. Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation, restart the PC and try again.

If the application does not open, try running it as Administrator.

Check the logs/ folder for any error messages if the system is not functioning correctly.
